# Proposal 232: Photometric follow-up of a Strongly Gravitationally Lensed Superluminous Supernova
SN 2025wny (ZTF25abnjznp/GOTO25gtq) is considered the first gravitationally lensed Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I) observed. We propose the photometric follow-up to measure the time delay of the different resolved images created by the gravitational lense and the opportunity to constrain the lens potential (PS1J0716+3821).
