# Proposal 236: Multicolor follow-up of SN
The candidate supernova ZTF25acegldq was just discovered on UTC 2025-11-25 12:17 by ZTF with magnitude r ~ 18.7. This is too faint for Unistellar telescopes to detect but should be well within TTT limits. Assuming it was discovered within a day or two of its eruption (likely given the ZTF cadence), the supernova should brighten by ~3–5 magnitudes over the next ~3-7 days, during which time it will become detectable by Unistellar telescopes. Thus, there is great synergy between the two observatories to build a light curve of this supernova from eruption to peak to fading tail. As a side note, a U.S. high school class will also be trying to observe and analyze this supernova as part of an astronomy education pilot project.

Observations changed to SN2025afcy.
